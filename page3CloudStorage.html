							<h1>What is Cloud Backup and How Does it Work?</h1>
							<p><span class="first-letter">C</span>loud backup, also known as online backup or remote backup, is a strategy for sending a copy of a physical or virtual file or database to a secondary, off-site location for preservation in case of equipment failure or catastrophe. The secondary server and storage systems are usually hosted by a third-party service provider, who charges the backup customer a fee based on storage space or capacity used, data transmission bandwidth, number of users, number of servers or number of times data is accessed.</p>

								<p>Implementing cloud data backup can help bolster an organization's data protection strategy without increasing the workload of information technology (IT) staff. The labor-saving benefit may be significant and enough of a consideration to offset some of the additional costs associated with cloud backup, such as data transmission charges.</p>

								<p>Most cloud subscriptions run on a monthly or yearly basis. While initially used mainly by consumers and home offices, online backup services are now commonly used by small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) as well as larger enterprises to back up some forms of data. For larger companies, cloud data backup may serve as a supplementary form of backup.</p>

								<h3>What is the cloud?</h3>
								<p><span class="first-letter">C</span>loud computing is a general term that refers to hosted services that are delivered over the internet. Different from traditional web hosting, the services on the cloud are sold on demand, are offered in an elastic manner -- meaning the customer can use as much or as little of the service as needed -- and are managed completely by the service provider. Additionally, a cloud can be private or public. A Public cloud sells services to anyone on the internet, such as how Amazon Web Services operates, while a private cloud supplies hosted services to a limited number of users.</p>

									In an organizationâ€™s data center, a backup application copies data and stores it on a different media or another storage system for easy access in the event of a recovery situation. While there are multiple options and approaches to off-site backup, cloud backup serves as the off-site facility for many organizations. In an enterprise, the company might own the off-site server if it hosts its own cloud service, but the chargeback method would be similar if the company uses a service provider to manage the cloud backup environment.</p>

									<p>There are a variety of approaches to cloud backup, with available services that can easily fit into an organization's existing data protection process. Varieties of cloud backup include:</p>
									
									<p>
									<ul>
									<li><B>Backing up directly to the public cloud.</B> One way to store organizational resources is by duplicating resources in the public cloud. This method entails writing data directly to cloud providers, such as AWS or Microsoft Azure. The organization uses its own backup software to create the data copy to send to the cloud storage service. The cloud storage service then provides the destination and safekeeping for the data, but it does not specifically provide a backup application. In this scenario, it is important that the backup software is capable of interfacing with the cloud's storage service. Additionally, with public cloud options, IT professionals may need to look into supplemental data protection procedures.</li>
									<br>
									<li><B>Backing up to a service provider.</B> In this scenario, an organization writes data to a cloud service provider that offers backup services in a managed data center. The backup software that the company uses to send its data to the service may be provided as part of the service, or the service may support specific commercially-available backup applications.</li>
									<br>
									<li><B>Choosing a cloud-to-cloud (C2C) backup.</B> These services are among the newest offerings in the cloud backup arena. They specialize in backing up data that already lives in the cloud, either as data created using a software as a service (SaaS) application or as data stored in a cloud backup service. As its name suggests, a cloud-to-cloud backup service copies data from one cloud to another cloud. The cloud-to-cloud backup service typically hosts the software that handles this process.</li>
									<br>
									<li><B>Using online cloud backup systems.</B> There are also hardware alternatives that facilitate backing up data to a cloud backup service. These appliances are all-in-one backup machines that include backup software and disk capacity along with the backup server. The appliances are about as close to plug-and-play as backup gets, and most of them also provide a seamless (or nearly so) link to one or more cloud backup services or cloud providers. The list of vendors that offer backup appliances that include cloud interfaces is long, with Quantum, Unitrends, Arcserve, Rubrik, Cohesity, Dell EMC, StorageCraft and Asigra active in this arena. These appliances typically retain the most recent backup locally, in addition to shipping it to the cloud backup provider, so that any required recoveries can be made from the local backup copy, saving time and transmission costs.</li>

						<div class="col-xs-12">
							<p><span class="first-letter">W</span>hen an organization engages a cloud backup service, the first step is to complete a full backup of the data that needs to be protected. This initial backup can sometimes take days to finish uploading over a network as a result of the large volume of data that is being transferred. In a 3-2-1 backup strategy, where an organization has three copies of data on two different media, at least one copy of the backed up data should be sent to an off-site backup facility so that it is accessible even if on-site systems are unavailable.</p>
							<p>Using a technique called cloud seeding, a cloud backup vendor sends a storage device -- such as a disk drive or tape cartridge -- to its new customer, which then backs up the data locally onto the device and returns it to the provider. This process removes the need to send the initial data over the network to the backup provider.</p>
							<p>If the amount of data in the initial backup is substantial, the cloud backup service may provide a full storage array for the seeding process. These arrays are typically small network-attached storage (NAS) devices that can be shipped back and forth relatively easily. After the initial seeding, only changed data is backed up over the network.</p>
