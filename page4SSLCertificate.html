							<h1>Why SSL? The Purpose of using SSL Certificates</h1>
							<p><span class="first-letter">S</span>SL is the backbone of our secure Internet and it protects your sensitive information as it travels across the world's computer networks. SSL is essential for protecting your website, even if it doesn't handle sensitive information like credit cards. It provides privacy, critical security and data integrity for both your websites and your users' personal information.
								</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row padding-bottom-30">
							<div class="col-xs-12">
								<h3>SSL Encrypts Sensitive Information</h3>
								<p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he primary reason why SSL is used is to keep sensitive information sent across the Internet encrypted so that only the intended recipient can access it. This is important because the information you send on the Internet is passed from computer to computer to get to the destination server. Any computer in between you and the server can see your credit card numbers, usernames and passwords, and other sensitive information if it is not encrypted with an SSL certificate. When an SSL certificate is used, the information becomes unreadable to everyone except for the server you are sending the information to. This protects it from hackers and identity thieves.</p>

					<div class="row padding-bottom-30">
						<div class="col-xs-12">
							<blockquote><q>The primary reason why SSL is used is to keep sensitive information sent across the Internet encrypted so that only the intended recipient can access it.</q></blockquote>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row padding-bottom-30">
						<div class="col-xs-12">
							<h3>SSL Provides Authentication</h3>
							<p><span class="first-letter">I</span>n addition to encryption, a proper SSL certificate also provides authentication. This means you can be sure that you are sending information to the right server and not to an imposter trying to steal your information. Why is this important? The nature of the Internet means that your customers will often be sending information through several computers. Any of these computers could pretend to be your website and trick your users into sending them personal information.  It is only possible to avoid this by getting an SSL Certificate from a trusted SSL provider.</p>

								<p>Why are SSL providers important? Trusted SSL providers will only issue an SSL certificate to a verified company that has gone through several identity checks. Certain types of SSL certificates, like EV SSL Certificates, require more validation than others. How do you know if an SSL provider is trusted? Web browser manufactures verify that SSL providers are following specific practices and have been audited by a third-party using a standard such as WebTrust.</p>

					<div class="row padding-bottom-30">
						<div class="col-xs-12">
							<h3>SSL Provides Trust</h3>
							<p><span class="first-letter">W</span>eb browsers give visual cues, such as a lock icon or a green bar, to make sure visitors know when their connection is secured. This means that they will trust your website more when they see these cues and will be more likely to buy from you. SSL providers will also give you a trust seal that instills more trust in your customers.</p>
								<p>HTTPS also protects against phishing attacks. A phishing email is an email sent by a criminal who tries to impersonate your website. The email usually includes a link to their own website or uses a man-in-the-middle attack to use your own domain name. Because it is very difficult for these criminals to receive a proper SSL certificate, they won’t be able to perfectly impersonate your site. This means that your users will be far less likely to fall for a phishing attack because they will be looking for the trust indicators in their browser, such as a green address bar, and they won’t see it.</p>

						<div class="col-xs-12">
							<h3>SSL is required for PCI Compliance</h3>
							<p><span class="first-letter">I</span>n order to accept credit card information on your website, you must pass certain audits that show that you are complying with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards. One of the requirements is properly using an SSL Certificate.
									
								</p>
						</div>

						<div class="col-xs-12">
							<h3>Disadvantages of SSL</h3>
							<p><span class="first-letter">W</span>ith so many advantages, why would anyone not use SSL? Are there any disadvantages to using SSL certificates? Cost is an obvious disadvantage. SSL providers need to set up a trusted infrastructure and validate your identity so there is a cost involved. This has been alleviated by increased competition in the industry. Performance is another disadvantage to SSL. Because the information that you send has to be encrypted by the server, it takes more server resources than if the information weren’t encrypted. The performance difference is only noticeable for web sites with very large numbers of visitors and can be minimized with special hardware in such cases.</p>
								<p>Overall, the disadvantages of using SSL are few and the advantages far outweigh them. It is critical that you properly use SSL on all websites. Proper use of SSL certificates will help protect your customers, help protect you, and help you to gain your customers trust and sell more.
