								<h3>PROTECT AND SECURE YOUR WEBSITE</h3>
								<p><span class="first-letter">W</span>e are sure you have been hearing about all the security breaches lately. Website security and cybersecurity should be a top priority for any business owner in the digital age. When you manage a website yourself you aren’t getting all the security features you might otherwise get when you allow an expert to take over.
									For example, most website managers will pull regular backups of your website just in case your website should ever be hacked. Website managers will also update plugins appropriately to prevent hackers from getting in through outdated software. A website manager is also there to monitor your website for suspicious activity, alert you, and fix any security problems should they arise.
									</p>
									<p>Clients ask all the time “Why would someone even want to hack my website?”. The answer is, hackers don’t discriminate. They are looking for any information they can get their hands on. This could be something as innocent as your client email list, phone numbers, etc. Even if you aren’t taking credit cards on your website you hold the keys to other valuable information hackers can use to steal someone’s identity or worse.</p>
									<p>Hackers can also completely destroy a website by changing or even deleting important files on your server. If you don’t have a backup this can cost thousands of dollars to recover, if it can even be recovered at all.</p>
									<p>Having this expert on your side will give you peace of mind that your website and investment is safe and secure.</p>

							<h3>BETTER CONTENT GIVES YOU MORE TRAFFIC</h3>
							<p><span class="first-letter">K</span>eeping the content up to date on your site helps build trust between you and your customers. Most likely, customers rely on your site for useful information on whatever market you are in.</p>  
								<p></p>Updated information also helps build domain authority. Domain authority,  explained, is how much of an authority on a particular subject your website is. For example, Wikipedia.org has one of the highest Domain authorities out there, because it’s content is always well researched, reviewed by editors, and you’re not distracted with unsightly or unrelated ads. Google holds this in high regard when trying to match search inquiries with useful and relevant information.</p>
								<p>Have you ever visited a website that’s copyright is 2014 and the latest blog post is years old as well? Does it make you wonder if they’re still in business, or if they still service your area? Having outdated content on your site, mentioning things like an old location of your business or not-modern technology, can be perceived by your potential customers that your business doesn’t keep up with the latest trends. Anytime a customer reads content on your site that makes them go “wait, I don’t understand that” or “wait, that’s not right”, you’re hurting your credibility.</p>

							<h3>KEEPING YOUR WEBSITE'S DESIGN UPTODATE</h3>
							<p><span class="first-letter">M</span>any businesses focus only on content and internet marketing but fail to address the design and navigation of their website. Some of the things to avoid on your website include difficult navigation, colors that are either too boring or far too obnoxious, and unnecessarily long customer contact forms. All of these things can lead to a website that steers customers away even if your content is top notch.</p>
							<h4>Mobile-Friendly Web Design</h4>
								<p>60% of web traffic now comes from mobile devices like iPhones, iPads, Android Phones, and Tablets. This means that if your website is not mobile-friendly and easy to view on a smaller screen, you could be missing out on over half of your potential customers. It’s that simple!</p>
								<h4>Keep the Target Market in Mind</h4>
								<p>A website’s design should focus around the needs of the target customer. This means providing easily accessible, engaging content that the ideal customer within your target market will find useful. It also means that the website is ultimately focused around converting those visitors into customers. Your target market may change over time as you expand your business, hire new employees, or invest in new tools, so be sure you’re adapting the content of your website accordingly.</p>
